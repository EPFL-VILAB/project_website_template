# A template website for vision/ML project pages <br> 

You can find the source in this repo. If you wish to see sample websites from the past we made using this template, you can see [Cross-Task Consistency](https://consistency.epfl.ch/), [Taskonomy](http://taskonomy.vision/), [Navigation Mid-Level Vision](http://perceptual.actor/).  Feel free to use it for yours! 

It should be github.io friendly (see [https://epfl-vilab.github.io/project_website_template/](https://epfl-vilab.github.io/project_website_template/)). The repo initializes with Cross-Task Consistency website (without the live demos).
